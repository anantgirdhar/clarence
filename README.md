# clarence (Command Line Academic ReferENCE manager)

A simple tool to manage a reading list / academic references offline and
through the command line.

I have three goals for this project:

1. Make the previous version more robust
2. Learn rust
3. Create something that I will enjoy using with a few additional features and
   tweaks as compared to the previous version

A word of caution: This is the first piece of code that I've ever tried to
write in rust (other than a few examples from the rust book) so the code is
probably not the most rust way of doing things and/or probably not the best way
of doing things. Hopefully, as I learn more, I can keep refactoring this to be
better / more rusty(?).
